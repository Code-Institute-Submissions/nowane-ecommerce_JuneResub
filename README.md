# Ecommerce | Full Stack Frameworks with Django

## Project Overview

This is the fourth milestone project in obtaining a **Full-Stack Web Development Diploma** from  **[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)**. The purpose of this project is building a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. Features of the project will include an authentication mechanism, as well as providing paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product or service.

The required main technologies for this project are **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **Python** + **Django**, using a relational database (MySQL or Postgres) and using Stripe payments. To improve the overall quality and user experience of the site other technologies were used as well. The full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section of this document.
