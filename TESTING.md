## Documentation of any bugs encountered and their resolution steps

- When trying to add the logo to the navigation bar, the image gave a 404 error.

![Error](media/testing/images/logo-error-1.png)

- This was resolved by adding the 'django.template.context_processors.media',  to the templates in settings.py

![Solution](media/testing/images/logo-error-solve.png)

- After the site was deployed to Heroku, and all static files got to run via Amazons S3 Bucket, the local site gave 404-errors when loading CSS and JS links. The deployed website however functioned as intended. 

![Error](media/testing/images/local-css-404.png)

- Checked for typo's in links / checked file paths [like suggested here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48248832/stylesheet-not-loaded-because-of-mime-type)
- Tried adding `<base href="/">` in the head before any styling links, like suggested here and at other sites as well.

- Eventually solved by setting `DEBUG = os.environ.get("DEVELOPMENT", True)`

- At the add_product template, toasts didn't show when adding a new product.

- Eventually I found out that having an empty postload_js block at the bottom of the template prevents the toasts from showing.

- When adding a product in the card with a quantity if less than 1 metre, the following error occurs.

![Error](media/testing/add-to-bag-error.png)

- ~~Solved by using float() instead if int() to be able to use a decimal value.~~ 

- After adjusting the contexts.py file to iterate through and show the bag items, the following error occured because of different operand types used.

![Error](media/testing/images/float-decimal-error-1.png)

![Error](media/testing/images/float-decimal-error-2.png)

- Solved by making `quantity = Decimal(request.POST.get('quantity'))` in views.py and `total += Decimal(quantity) * product.price` in contexts.py. 

- However when adding to bag the following error occured: "TypeError at /bag/add/1/ Object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable".
